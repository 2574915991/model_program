            A new, improved infinite element based on mapping is proposed for modelling unbounded domain problems. Mapping has previously been used in such problems, not only for the entire domain, but also for the infinite element itself. The novelty of the present approach is the simplicity of the mapping, and the retention of standard integration abscissae and weights. The implementation of these elements is very straightforward, and they are ideally suited for the analysis of infinite domain static problems in two and three dimensions.},
